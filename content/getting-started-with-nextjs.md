Next.js is a powerful and **popular ReactJS framework** for building server-side rendered React applications. It provides developers with a powerful set of features and tools to help them build fast, scalable, and SEO-friendly applications with ease. Next.js is built on top of React and Node.js, and it allows you to write server-side code using JavaScript, making it a great choice for full-stack developers who want to build modern web applications. In this blog post, we will explore the features of Next.js and how it can be used to build high-performance applications. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, this post will provide you with a solid understanding of what Next.js is and how it can help you build better web applications.

## Why would we then need NextJS?

There are several reasons why you should consider using Next.js for your next web development project. Here are some of the key benefits:

- Server-Side Rendering: Next.js allows you to easily implement server-side rendering (SSR) for your React applications, which can significantly improve performance and SEO. SSR enables your application to render on the server-side before being sent to the client, resulting in faster load times and better search engine rankings.

- Automatic Code Splitting: Next.js automatically splits your JavaScript code into smaller, more manageable chunks, which can be loaded as needed. This feature helps to reduce the initial load time of your application and improves overall performance.

- Fast Refresh: Next.js comes with a feature called Fast Refresh, which allows you to see your changes instantly as you develop your application. This makes the development process faster and more efficient, as you don't have to constantly reload the page to see your changes.

- API Routes: Next.js makes it easy to create API endpoints for your application, allowing you to build a complete full-stack application using just one framework. This feature can save you time and reduce complexity in your codebase.

- Easy Deployment: Next.js comes with built-in support for various deployment options, including serverless deployment, static site generation, and traditional server deployment. This makes it easy to deploy your application to the cloud or any other hosting platform.
