#### JavaScript is a popular programming language...

used primarily for web development. It is a versatile and flexible language that can be used for both client-side and server-side programming. JavaScript is a dynamic language, meaning it can be used to create interactive and dynamic elements on web pages, such as animations and user interfaces. It is also used for data manipulation, event handling, and more. JavaScript has a vast and active community with many libraries, frameworks, and tools available, making it a popular choice for developers.

For example, you should understand code like this:

```js
// Create a variable
let myVariable = "Hello, world!";

// Declare a function
const printVariable = () => {
  // Log the variable to the console
  console.log(myVariable);
};

// Call the function to log the variable to the console
console.log(myVariable);
```

This code creates a variable called **myVariable** and sets it to the string **"Hello, world!"**. It then logs the value of **myVariable** to the console using the **printVariable** function. When you run this code, you should see the string "Hello, world!" printed to the console.
