# App is deployed [here](https://nextjs-blog-website-six.vercel.app/).

## Welcome to my NextJS project - a blog website where you can read and explore blog posts on programming topics. I created this project as a part of a NextJS course and it has been designed to showcase the capabilities of NextJS as a React framework. The website allows you to browse through a list of posts and view individual posts in detail. Additionally, you can leave your feedback through a contact form. I hope you enjoy exploring this project and find it both informative and engaging.

### This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
